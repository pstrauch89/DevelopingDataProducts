Automobile catalog filter
==================

This application is based on 'mtcars' database (the data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine). Dataset is part of [datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) package.

The application allows to filter cars by parameters (hp, cyl) and to check correlation between weight and miles/gallon.

You can adjust horsepower range and number of cylinders using control panel located on the left side. The result is shown in the main panel (on the right side of the page), which include two tabs with plot and data.
Also filtered dataset can be downloaded using download button.

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/pstrauch89/DevelopingDataProducts).

The presentation for the project can be found on the [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/Frankie/DevelopingDataProduct).
