The goal of this presentation
========================================================
- This is part of the course project for "Developing Data Products" course. 

- The presentation describes the shiny application "Automobile catalog filter".



The Application
========================================================
Application **Automobile catalog filter** is based on 'mtcars' database, part of [datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) package.

The application allows to *filter cars by parameters (hp, cyl)* and to check correlation between weight and miles/gallon.

You can adjust *horsepower range* and *number of cylinders* using control panel located on the left side. The result is shown in the main panel (on the right side of the page), which include two tabs with *plot* and *data*. Also filtered dataset can be downloaded using *download button*.


Filtering data
========================================================
The application is based on interactive filter; filtered data is shown in the table and plot. Example of table is below:



```r
arrange(filter(data, hp >= 100,hp <= 200, cyl == 4|cyl == 6), name)
```

```
            name  mpg cyl  disp  hp    wt
1   Ferrari Dino 19.7   6 145.0 175 2.770
